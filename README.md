# QuantumChemistrySimulations

This repo serves as a container for everything done during my master's thesis specialization project.

In this repository you will find python scripts which contain:
- Using quantum computing to solve the electronic structure problem in quantum chemistry.
- Simulations of the Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow ansatz on a quantum circuit by utilizing the `ffsim` library and `qiskit`.
- Classical quantum circuit simulations with tensor network methods, via the `matrix_product_state` method from `qiskit-aer`.
- Sample based Quantum Diagonalization with samples from real IBM-Q jobs.
- Variational quantum eigensolver simulations on a matrix product state tensor network with various optimizers like **QN-SPSA**, **SPSA**,  **L-BFGS-B** and the **Linear Method for Optimizing Jastrow-Feenberg correlations**.
 
This repository contains scripts and usage of my development library `fqcsim` (see https://github.com/davidomanovic/fqcsim) for different experiments quantum computing applications.
